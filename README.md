This repository showcases my complete hands-on learning of SQLAlchemy ORM with MySQL8, from fundamentals to production-ready async patterns. I practiced models, relationships, advanced queries, sessions, transactions, performance tuning, raw SQL, async engine, and FastAPI integration. This demonstrates strong backend capability with SQLAlchemy and real database problem-solving skills.
