This repository is a practical end-to-end learning project for mastering SQLAlchemy ORM (Python 3.12) with MySQL 8, covering everything from fundamentals to advanced concepts.
It includes structured modules, real-world CRUD layers, relationship modeling, loading strategies, and optimized query patterns.
I am continuously adding new examples as I deepen my expertise in Python backend architecture, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, and modern database practices.
